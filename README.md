### Howdy, partner ü§†

&emsp;I'm Caleb, but I usually go by Elite online. I have on-off history with programming as far back as 21~22 years now; Starting right before I turned 7. My dad helped initially show me how to do computer repairs, which included performing operations, and making scripts (Back when we still used Floppy Drives). On my free time I started messing around with batch and inspect element, 
> "Oh, when I changed this value, it just made the text turn red" 

...and these curiosity moments sparked my interest to actually learn languages properly.
